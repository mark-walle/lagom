As I begin this post, f.lux has just adjusted the monitor luminance down to a candle-like 1900 Kelvin, reminding me that it's late. As stated, today I finished configuring Github Pages for the first time, which has meant some quick reading on Jekyll, finding a theme, and configuring the repository to host a page. Despite being the first time I've tried this, it was surprisingly straightforward.

The motivation from this comes from the negging task over my head that is to create a personal portfolio at some point. Instead I've been lately distracted attending [battlesnake](battlesnake.io), [Hack Uvic](hackuvic.com), learning [MEAN Stack Development](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

**Goals** for this over the next short while are:
1) Create posts for a number of projects, plans, readings, or other interesting things.
2) Learn Jekyll better and begin formulating a theme for use here. I like this theme, [Lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom), but it lacks a personal zest. I am currently really into CLI and Outrun, so it might be something hybridizing those things.
3) Mix it in with a landing site to host at MarkWalle.com; this blog being linked through that.

I am also a little enthusiastic to just write something for myself, which will be this first in doing so in a long time. For now, that is all. Goodnight.
